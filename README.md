This is a website about cats. main.html has Bootstrap buttons to go to each of the different pages, and uses Bootstrap's grid model to display the four images of cats. cat.html has an unordered list of a few different cat breeds, and each has an image. bigcats.html has an unordered list of different big cat species, and below that there are two images, each of which will change when the mouse hovers over it. meow.html has a table with "meow" in different languages. Each page has a button to return to the home page. style.scss contains all the styling information, such as spacing and borders in the table, the changing background images for the tiger and jaguar, and styling for the emojis. style.css is the compiled css file.
